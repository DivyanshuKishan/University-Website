            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Program For 2021</h2>
            <p>We all know going to college is about more than going to class. Talk to your career services office, 
                get a few recommendations on students with interesting internship placements, and then ask them to write about it, 
                either periodically throughout the summer or semester, or after the internship is over and they’ve had a chance to reflect.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I was considering colleges, I learned about our school’s “midnight madness” event, 
                    a student event that started at – you guessed it – midnight, and helped kick-off the start of basketball season. 
                    Don’t let these events go private. They’re excellent content opportunities.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I have to give a shout-out to Princeton University for this idea. To many students, work-study jobs are a necessary part of campus life. 
                    I love the concept of taking something that isn’t traditionally a selling point and making it one. Well done, Princeton.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>This idea comes courtesy of Duke University, and what I love about this idea is how it 
                    expands the scope of what you consider “content.” Spotify playlists are a trendy way to showcase what your students are into. 
                    If you’re looking to go down this road, 
                    consider making different playlists for studying, homecoming, graduation, etc.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I’m borrowing inspiration from Duke again, but I know that other schools are creating 
                    similar content around this theme. This concept works because it’s technically a blog post for 
                    current students, which expands its reach, but it’s a sneaky way to showcase your campus and its buildings. Pro tip: consider posting the photos of the study spots on Pinterest, 
                    and then embedding the Pinterest board into the blog post.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>This one comes to you via the University of New Mexico. I could see this really taking off with art schools and STEM programs. 
                    Your students are doing incredible things on campus; tap into that and share those projects with the world. Not sure how to find these content opportunities? Consider creating an avenue for faculty to recommend projects for expanded coverage. 
                    It’s a win for them, the student, and the university.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>You may read this headline and think that your prospective students don’t care about this, 
                    but they really do. The key to succeeding with this type of content is to ask several different students 
                    to document their day-to-day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Along the same line, give students a clear idea of what a sample semester course schedule may look like for them. 
                        When do students go to class? What do they do at night? Do students have classes on Friday? Consider asking students from different 
                        class years 
                        and different programs to write these posts.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Prospective students want to get involved on campus. Showcase the different organizations they can join, 
                        and document the exciting things those organizations are accomplishing.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Did you know that fewer than 10% of all U.S. undergrad students study abroad? I guarantee you more than 10% of incoming U.S. 
                        undergrad students plan to study abroad. Cater to the latter group.</p>
